# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a very basic number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you open the page, it asks you to enter a maximum number, and the computer picks a random number between 1 and that. You then try to guess the number, and it will guide you by saying whether your guess is too high or too low.

When you open the game, it first asks you to enter a maximum number. Then, the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and that maximum. You try to guess the number by typing your guesses. If your guess is too high or too low, the game gives you a hint. You keep guessing until you get the right answer or type "quit" to exit the game.

The game uses simple JavaScript concepts like prompt(), console.log(), loops, conditionals, and Math.random() to create the logic. This was a small practice project to apply what I’ve been learning so far, especially how random numbers work in JavaScript.

You can play the game in the browser itself. Just refresh the page to play again or type "quit" if you want to stop. It’s a small project, but a good start for building confidence with basic JavaScript.
